        "1. From the abstract, this paper deals with how datasets should be oreinted in a 'tidy' way, with columns and rows relating to varaibles and observations respectively. This standardized framework gives a template for how to arrange messy data, and streamlines the eventual analysis aspect.\n",
        "2. The tiny data standard is intended to a form of data cleaning that is approachable to statisticians, as well as making subsequent analysis easier. The end goal is to make the development of said analysis tools easier as well since datasets would be organized according to shared principles.\n",
        "3. The sentence references how clean datasets will be similar/identical, just like happy families. This is the opposite of messy data, that often has its own unique issues that need to be solved. The second sentences referenes how easy it often is to identify what rows/columns are in regards to being an observation or variable; however, it is more difficult to precisely explain what that observation is and how it should be translated.\n",
        "4. Wickham defines values as being either numbers of strings that are then organized. Variables represent one way of organizing, with a variable being all the values that can describe an attribute (degrees for temp as an example). An observation is the other way, which relates to all the values that full under a unit of whatever is being observed (often a person or year/day).\n",
        "5. Tidy data is described as a standardized way of. taking the strucutre of the dataset and giving it a meaning. Often to simplify further analysis.\n",
        "6. Column headers as values, not variable names, more than one variable in a column, variables are in columns and rows, multiple observations in the same table, a singular observation is stored in multiple tables. In the case of table 4, the variables are not all columns, but instead income is a row. Melting is taking issues like this and placing all variables into columns.\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy given its poor represenation of the days in. amonth, instead of being tidy it ends up with tons of empty values. Table 12 ends up as tidy since it took the undesirable year, month, and day into a cohesive 'date' column.\n",
        "8. In order to get real benefits out of the tidy data frameowrk, you need the right tools/processes. Without these tools, putting data in the tidy system isn't super useful and thus it likely won't be done. He hopes that people cna use tidy data as a jumping off point to inspire new, innovative forms of data wrangling. He also hopes to study more about the cognitive side to further improve his system."

        "1. The US Census has people self-identify their race and allows them to pick multiple options as well as select their ethnicity. These options come from preselected categories that cover multiple sub categories.\n",
        "2. Census data is allegedly collected to inform the government for things like vote allocation and eventually funding. In politics, house seats are assigned according to population, but often politics uses race/religious information in gerrymandering efforts. For society, this info is supposed to go towards informing government intiatives aimed at certain demographics. Data quality is extremely important when things like congressional seats are being determined, this extends to ensuring funds are sent to the right areas.\n",
        "3. With the census often being sent out in the mail, it risks missing anyone who might find themselves displaced from a permanent address. Practically, I do commend the Census Bureau for how well they handle having to get data on hundreds of millions of individuals. I think the political coverage of President Trump wanting to ignore undocumented immigrants created tension around counting them.\n",
        "4. For a category like race, there is a legitimate case to be made that the overarching categories are quite limiting. To better capture diversity, the most basic change is just to allow the collection of more data points for the various subcategories of each race. However, the current form is basically a version of data wrangling that would later be done by a researcher. I think gender is likely a massive shortcoming of the current census process, particuarly given that many identify outside of male or female. I think it would be improved by having other options. I think the option to select more than one race in the census is still a very good thing that many other surveys do not do.\n",
        "5. I am majorly concerned over how future data scientists might use the excuse of data cleaning to not count, or simply, those that do not fit into neat gender or racial categories. If there is a missing value from someone who might not be comfortable, I can easily see someone simply wiping that observation from the dataset, removing their say. Another option is the idea that policymakers might abuse that info in order to attack certain groups. I think a first step is just making sure that data scientists receive the right education on handling these sensitive identites, and appreciate the nuance before they wipe an observation off the dataset.\n",
        "6. I am hesitant to trust any for of algorithm that deals with sensistive categories. This is becuase these bits of code often make unintentional mistakes that directly harm these groups. Even if that didn't occur, a value might still fail to encapsulate the nuances of those identities."
